I am an epidemiologist working in dementia and psychiatry research. My main interests are in design and analysis of RCTs and causal inference methods in observational studies. 

Iâ€™m using this website to share detail of the various analytical/philosophical problems I encounter in the course of this research work, and, hopefully, my best attempts at reaching some kind of solution or understanding.
